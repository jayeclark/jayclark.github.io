I\u2019ve contributed code to 70+ Open Source Software projects, and am completing professional certificates in Data Science and Machine Learning to round out my full-stack training. </p><p> When the pandemic put my small business executive job on pause, I reflected on my past roles and realized I&#39;d gravitated toward software development projects in each, even though that wasn&#39;t my primary role to begin with. I started to give serious, deep thought to the future direction of my career, and realized I&#39;d felt most fulfilled (and most useful) applying technology to solve business problems. </p><p> I started looking for software development roles, but soon realized I couldn&#39;t get the kind of role I really wanted - there were too many gaps in my technical knowledge. I rented out my house, hit the road as a digital nomad (new experiences are the PERFECT backdrop for learning), and embarked on a 12-month training program of self study accompanied by four professional certificates: Intro to Computer Science, Full-stack Web Development, Data Science, and Machine Learning. </p><p> My previous experience includes co-founding and running a talent management business for gaming content creators, working in management consulting, teaching at Harvard &amp; MIT, and internships at a nonprofit biotech and a software startup. I received my AB magna cum laude from Harvard, where my thesis on internet culture was nominated for a Hoopes Prize. </p><p> In my spare time, I enjoy traveling, exercising (I&#39;m working very hard at shedding weight gained after a back injury), volunteering for my neighborhood cat rescue organization, and cultivating my amateur chef &amp; photographer skills. </p></div>',2),h={id:"bottom-contact-card",class:"contact card-white",style:{"margin-bottom":"80px","margin-top":"60px"}},g={class:"card-container"},f={class:"card-content offset-small"},y=e("h2",null,"Hire me",-1),_=e("p",null," I'm looking for full-time W2 or 1099 employment.
