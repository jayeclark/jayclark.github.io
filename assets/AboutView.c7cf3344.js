But in every job - academia, real estate development, management consulting, entrepreneurship - software engineering work found and fascinated me. Whenever I faced a tough business problem, software engineering was how I solved it. </p><br><p> In grad school, while teaching at Harvard &amp; MIT, I built a content management system. As a management consultant, I built &amp; deployed a mission-critical real-time GPS tracking and dispatch app for an airport shuttle collective. </p><br><p> From 2015 to 2020, I served as COO &amp; acting CTO of a bootstrapped startup that provided talent management services for professional videogame content creators. I ran a small tech team and served as a product manager for our data ingestion pieline and viewership analytics platform. I was also the sole developer working on building a machine learning-driven talent management system on top of our analytics platform. Our unique tech-driven approach to content creator talent management was profiled in The New Yorker&#39;s 2017 tech issue. </p><br><p> Unfortunately, that startup failed three months into the pandemic. When the dust settled, I realized I was no longer willing to have software development be just a neat &#39;after hours&#39; project - mostly because the after hours project had grown into an entire second job! I needed software engineering to be my day to day. </p><br><p> I was a self-taught developer with no mentor. That had left me with some knowledge gaps that I needed to fill if I wanted to commit seriously to engineering excellence. I packed up my belongings, hit the road as a digital nomad, and embarked on a 15-month program of self-study and self-improvement, accompanied by coursework for three professional certificates: Full-stack Web Development with MERN, Data Science, and Machine Learning, Modeling &amp; Simulation. </p><br><p> My plan worked, and in 2022 I landed a role on a machine learning and telemetry oriented data team in the Amazon Physical Stores org. Though my role was eliminated as part of a reduction in force, I&#39;m grateful for the work I was able to do and the software &amp; systems I was able to improve during my brief time on the team, and I&#39;m looking forward to finding the next team where I can contribute my talents and enthusiasm. </p><br><p> In my spare time, I enjoy traveling (mainly to Puerto Rico and Venice), cooking, and amateur food photography. I volunteer for a San Juan, Puerto Rico based cat rescue organization both on the tech front (improving their website to raise more funds) and by fostering feral kittens to make them adopable (they and their adorable toebeans are frequent guest stars on my conference calls). I&#39;m based in San Diego but travel often to Seattle, San Franscisco, New York, and Boston. </p>",16),_={id:"bottom-contact-card",class:"contact card-white",style:{"margin-bottom":"80px","margin-top":"60px"}},I={class:"card-container"},k={class:"card-content offset-small"},x=e("h2",null,"Hire me",-1),S=e("p",null," I'm looking for full-time W2 or 1099 employment.
