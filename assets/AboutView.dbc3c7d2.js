But in every job, from academia to real estate development to management consulting &amp; entrepreneurship, software development work found and fascinated me. In grad school, while teaching at Harvard &amp; MIT, I built a content management system. As a management consultant, I built &amp; deployed a mission-critical real-time GPS tracking and dispatch app for an airport shuttle collective. As an executive and acting CTO at a startup, I became an individual contributor after-hours, and built a machine learning-driven talent management platform that resulted in my company being profiled in The New Yorker&#39;s 2017 tech issue. No matter what I did, I was constantly solving tough business problems through software engineering. </p><p> From 2015 to 2020, I served as COO &amp; acting CTO of a bootstrapped startup that provided talent management services for professional videogame content creators at Twitch, YouTube, Facebook, and Beam (Microsoft). I ran a small 3-person tech team, was the sole developer working on the systems that drove our business and processed our clients&#39; sponsorship payments, and played a product management role on our data ingestion pipeline and viewership analytics platform. </p><p> That startup unfortunately failed three months into the pandemic. When the dust settled, I realized I was no longer willing to have software development be just an &#39;after hours&#39; project - mostly because the after hours project had grown into an entire second job! I needed software development to be my day to day. </p><p> Being a self-taught developer without a mentor had left me with some knowledge gaps! While I was capable of complex tasks that bordered on &#39;Senior Developer&#39; territory (like productionizing a machine learning model to predict ideal rates to charge for sponsored content), my lack of formal training in CS was apparent. I packed up my belongings, hit the road as a digital nomad, and embarked on a 15-month training program of self-study and self-improvement accompanied by coursework for three professional certificates: Full-stack Web Development with MERN, Data Science, and Machine Learning, Modeling &amp; Simulation. </p><p> My plan worked, and in 2022 I landed a role on a machine learning and telemetry oriented data team in the Amazon Physical Stores org. Though my role was eliminated as part of a massive reduction in force, I&#39;m grateful for the work I was able to do and the software &amp; systems I was able to improve during my brief time on the team, and I&#39;m looking forward to finding the next team where I can contribute my talents and enthusiasm. </p><p> In my spare time, I enjoy traveling (mainly to Puerto Rico and Venice), cooking, and amateur food photography. I volunteer for a San Juan, Puerto Rico based cat rescue organization both on the tech front (improving their website to raise more funds) and by fostering feral kittens to make them adopable (they and their adorable toebeans are frequent guest stars on my conference calls). I&#39;m based in San Diego but travel often to Seattle, San Franscisco, New York, and Boston. </p>",8),_={id:"bottom-contact-card",class:"contact card-white",style:{"margin-bottom":"80px","margin-top":"60px"}},I={class:"card-container"},k={class:"card-content offset-small"},x=e("h2",null,"Hire me",-1),S=e("p",null," I'm looking for full-time W2 or 1099 employment.
