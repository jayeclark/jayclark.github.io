I\u2019ve contributed code to 80+ Open Source Software projects, and am completing professional certificates in Data Science and Machine Learning to round out my full-stack training. </p><p> The small business I worked for closed three months into the pandemic. I reflected on my past roles and realized I&#39;d gravitated toward software development projects in each, even though that hadn&#39;t been my primary role to begin with. I realized I&#39;d felt most fulfilled (and most useful) applying technology to solve business problems. </p><p> Seven years of being a self-taught, part-time solo developer left me with some serious knowledge gaps! I rented out my house, hit the road as a digital nomad (new experiences are the PERFECT backdrop for learning), and embarked on a 12-month training program of self-study and self-improvement accompanied by four professional certificates: Intro to Computer Science, Full-stack Web Development, Data Science, and Machine Learning. </p><p> My previous experience includes co-founding and running a talent management business for gaming content creators, working in management consulting, teaching at Harvard &amp; MIT, and internships at a nonprofit biotech and a software startup. I received my AB magna cum laude from Harvard, where my thesis on internet culture was nominated for a Hoopes Prize. </p><p> In my spare time, I enjoy traveling, cooking, and amateur food photography. I spend a lot of my free time exercising - I&#39;m working very hard at shedding weight gained after the one-two punch of a back injury and the the pandemic. I also volunteer for my neighborhood cat rescue organization both on the tech front (improving their website to raise more funds) and by fostering feral kittens to make them adopable (they and their adorable toebeans are frequent guest stars on my Zoom calls), and cultivating my amateur chef &amp; photographer skills. </p></div>',5),h={id:"bottom-contact-card",class:"contact card-white",style:{"margin-bottom":"80px","margin-top":"60px"}},u={class:"card-container"},g={class:"card-content offset-small"},f=e("h2",null,"Hire me",-1),y=e("p",null," I'm looking for full-time W2 or 1099 employment.
