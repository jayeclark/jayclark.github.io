I started to give serious, deep thought to what that &#39;right&#39; type of work might be, and realized I&#39;d felt most fulfilled (and most useful) applying technology to solve business problems. </p><p> In May 2021, I took the humbling step of completely rebooting my career, starting over from scratch as a software engineer. </p><p> My previous experience includes co-founding and running a talent management business for gaming content creators, working in management consulting, and internships at a nonprofit biotech and a software startup. I received my AB <i>magna cum laude</i> from Harvard, where my thesis on internet culture was nominated for a Hoopes Prize. </p><p> In my spare time, I enjoy traveling, assembling IKEA furniture, Bikram yoga, and the culinary arts. You can see some of my culinary plating ventures on my hobby <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jennbot3000/" target="_blank">Instagram</a> account. I collect silvestre Mezcals (made from wild harvested agave) and obscure worm salts to accompany them. I&#39;ve never lived more than 10 minutes from the ocean. </p></div>',2),h={id:"bottom-contact-card",class:"contact card-white",style:{"margin-bottom":"80px","margin-top":"60px"}},g={class:"card-container"},_={class:"card-content offset-small"},y=e("h2",null,"Hire me",-1),f=e("p",null," I'm looking for full-time W2 or 1099 employment.
