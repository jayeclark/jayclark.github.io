      <p>
        I'm a career-transitioning full stack SWE focusing on React, Express &
        Node.js. Iâ€™ve contributed code to 70+ Open Source Software projects, and
        am completing professional certificates in Data Science and Machine
        Learning to round out my full-stack training.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the pandemic put my small business executive job on pause, I
        reflected on my past roles and realized I'd gravitated toward software
        development projects in each, even though that wasn't my primary role to
        begin with. I started to give serious, deep thought to the future
        direction of my career, and realized I'd felt most fulfilled (and most
        useful) applying technology to solve business problems.
      </p>

      <p>
        I started looking for software development roles, but soon realized I
        couldn't get the kind of role I really wanted - there were too many gaps in
        my technical knowledge. I rented out my house, hit the road as a digital
        nomad (new experiences are the PERFECT backdrop for learning), and
        embarked on a 12-month training program of self study accompanied by
        four professional certificates: Intro to Computer Science, Full-stack
        Web Development, Data Science, and Machine Learning.
      </p>

      <p>
        My previous experience includes co-founding and running a talent
        management business for gaming content creators, working in management
        consulting, teaching at Harvard & MIT, and internships at a nonprofit
        biotech and a software startup. I received my AB magna cum laude from
        Harvard, where my thesis on internet culture was nominated for a Hoopes
        Prize.
      </p>

      <p>
        In my spare time, I enjoy traveling, exercising (I'm working very hard
        at shedding weight gained after a back injury), volunteering for my
        neighborhood cat rescue organization, and cultivating my amateur chef &
        photographer skills.
